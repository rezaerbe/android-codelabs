## Material Components (MDC)

### [MDC-101 Android: Material Components (MDC) Basics (Kotlin)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-kotlin)

**Material Design** is a system for building bold and beautiful digital products. By uniting style, branding, interaction, and motion under a consistent set of principles and components, product teams can realize their greatest design potential.

For Android applications, **Material Components for Android** (**MDC Android**) unites design and engineering with a library of components for creating consistency across your app. As the Material Design system evolves, these components are updated to ensure consistent pixel-perfect implementation and adherence to Google's front-end development standards. MDC is also available for the web, iOS, and Flutter.

In this codelab, you'll build a login page using several of MDC Android's components.

Using basic XML markup and ~30 lines of Kotlin, the Material Components for Android library has helped you create a beautiful login page that conforms to the Material Design guidelines, and also looks and behaves consistently across all devices.

### [MDC-102 Android: Material Structure and Layout (Kotlin)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-102-kotlin)

In codelab MDC-101, you used two Material Components (MDC) to build a login page: text fields and buttons with ink ripples. Now let's expand upon this foundation by adding navigation, structure, and data.

Our app has a basic flow that takes the user from the login screen to a home screen, where products can be viewed. In just a few lines of code, we added a top app bar with a title and three buttons, and a grid of cards to present our app's content. Our home screen is now simple and functional, with a basic structure and actionable content.

### [MDC-103 Android: Material Theming with Color, Elevation and Type (Kotlin)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-103-kotlin)

In codelabs MDC-101 and MDC-102, you used Material Components (MDC) to build the basics of an app called **Shrine**, an e-commerce app that sells clothing and home goods. This app contains a user flow that starts with a login screen and takes the user to the home screen that displays products.

The recent expansion of Material Design gives designers and developers increased flexibility to express their product's brand. You can now use MDC to customize Shrine and reflect its unique style.

By now, you've created an app that resembles the design specifications from your designer.

### [MDC-104 Android: Material Advanced Components (Kotlin)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-104-kotlin)

In codelab MDC-103, you customized the color, elevation, and typography, of Material Components (MDC) to style your app.

A component in the Material Design system performs a set of predefined tasks and has certain characteristics, like a button. However, a button is more than just a way for a user to perform an action, it's also a visual expression of shape, size, and color that lets the user know that it's interactive, and that something will happen upon touch or click.

The Material Design guidelines describe components from a designer's point of view. They describe a wide range of basic functions available across platforms, as well as the anatomic elements that make up each component. For instance, a backdrop contains a back layer and its content, the front layer and its content, motion rules, and display options. Each of these components can be customized for each app's needs, use cases, and content. These pieces are, for the most part, traditional views, controls, and functions from your platform's SDK.

While the Material Design guidelines name many components, not all of them are good candidates for reusable code and therefore aren't found in MDC. You can create these experiences yourself to achieve a customized style for your app, all using traditional code.

Over the course of these four codelabs, you've seen how to use Material Components to build unique, elegant user experiences that express a brand's personality and style.
